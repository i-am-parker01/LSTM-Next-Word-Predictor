# LSTM-Next-Word-Predictor
📝 Next Word Predictor using LSTM RNN
This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the most probable next word, similar to how modern keyboards and text editors suggest words while typing.
